![](autumn-impressions-peeking-snail.jpg)

One of my previous workplaces was located very close to Tab√°n in
Budapest and sometimes I walked a fair distance to clear my head. There
was a location during the walk where I regularly saw moss and small
snails so I decided to take my camera with me a few times. I was
fortunate enough to come across this small snail, hiding. When you're
just a few centimeters from them they are much faster than from a
distance :)
