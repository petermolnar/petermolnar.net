This photo is from last year, when the UK rules were relaxed enough to
allow some domestic travel, and we went to Snowdonia. We've been there
quite a few times, and while we enjoyed it after months of lockdown, the
weather was far, from gentle. This doesn't change the fact that the
landscape is still fantastic.
