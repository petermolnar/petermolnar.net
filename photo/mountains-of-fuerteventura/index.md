There is a rather empty road on Fuerteventura, the one that goes through
Betancuria, in the mountains, to the south, FV-30. I can certainly
recommend taking this route if you can: it's calm, outerworldly, with
ravens visiting you at the miradors, showing all the beautiful mountains
on the west side of the island.
