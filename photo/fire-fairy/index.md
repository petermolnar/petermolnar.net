Fire Fairy by Szabina Fogarasi

Our friends from Mare Temporis asked my wife, Nora Hamucska, to take a
few promotional pictures for them for their pretty awesome show, "The
Prince and the Dragon" (A herceg és a sárkány).

I could not resist not to take a few photos myself.

I nearly never manipulate my images - in terms of Photoshop retouching,
not as levels and color fixing -, but I had to remove some lights from
the background; they were somewhat runining the experience.
