There is a relic in Budapest from a previous era, called Csepel
MÅ±vek[^1]. During its good ol' days, it gave work to 20 000 people, had
its own infrastructure, internal post network, and so on.

Sadly half of it is abandoned, including some large halls, abandoned and
left to rot, with even their floor taken aways.

We took some photos with Lini there a long time ago; this is the one I
liked the most.
