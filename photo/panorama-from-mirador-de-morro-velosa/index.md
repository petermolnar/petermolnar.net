title: Panorama from Mirador De Morro Velosa

![](panorama-from-mirador-de-morro-velosa.jpg)

When visiting a mirador, one might expect a place to buy coffee next to
a magnificent view, but Mirador De Morro Velosa offers a lot more.
Besides the panoramic view, the building also functions as a museum
about the islands and their origins - and yes, you can still get a
Cortado leche v leche.

Since my camera doesn't have a panorama function, I had to improvise: 4
handheld shoots combined perfectly with Hugin turned out better, than I
expected.
