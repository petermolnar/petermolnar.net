title: A view from Idwal

![](./wales-view-from-idwal.jpg)

This isn't the first image I took from the same scenery, but this is the
first panorama that is acceptable. At the Lake Idwal parking lot,
there's a small road that leads into the mountains; the view is much
better for a panorama, from there, than from the main road.
