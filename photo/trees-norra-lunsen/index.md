Norra Lunsen[^1] is a nature reserve right next to the Swedish city,
Uppsala. A while ago they decided to restore the original, marsh state
of the area. You mostly walk on wooden planks and the green "meadow"
below you is not grass; it's pitch black water covered in duckweed. The
creaking of the half-dead trees, the black water and the silence are all
adding up to a pretty much haunted feeling. If you happen to be close to
it, visit it.
