Trying to capture water is tricky, since many of us will fall into the
trap of too long exposure. I've seen brilliant, multi-long-exposure
photographs, which I'm way to far to master at this point, but the
not-too-long exposure I'm getting slightly better with. What surprised
me after taking this shoot is the focal length I made it with: 43mm. The
16-85 zoom gives you plenty of options, yet I ended up very close to my
usual weapon of choice, 50mm (75mm eq. since I'm on APS-C), and I also
ended up with a focal length that used to exist for Pentax as a prime.
