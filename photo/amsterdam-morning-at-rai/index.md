![](amsterdam-morning-at-rai.jpg)

It may not seem like, but was taken at a morning, when people started
waking up and getting into the city.

I don't usually do this, but I cropped the image a little, dropping the
very bottom of red tail-lights, and the very top of not too significant
blues. Without the red tail lights it gives more of a morning expression
in my opinion.
