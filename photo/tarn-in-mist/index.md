![](tarn-in-mist.jpg)

Back when I started taking photographs a bit more seriously I came
across a professional artist: Adam Gibbs[^1]. Since he is also a
mounteneer he gets to places literally noone else does.

During our short, three days stay in the Lake District we decided to
spend one of the days climbing up to a tarn - a smal lake on a top of a
hill. It wasn't too steep yet it took a long time to climb it, mostly
because of the uncleaned routes; I took this picture while it was still
misty all around.

I do envy Adam for getting those locations, but excursions like this
keep remind me how much work goes into a single picture.
