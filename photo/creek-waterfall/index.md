title: Waterfall in a creek

---

![](creek-waterfall.jpg)

I previously mentioned I went looking for waterfalls in Herefordshire,
following markings on openstreetmaps. This was above the marked part of
the waterfall, where it was mostly a stream, but I liked this part
better, than the real waterfall - which, just to note, is basically
dried out this time of the year.

I got to test our new lens, a Pentax 12-24mm (APS-C), and I'm quite
positively impressed by the angle (18mm equivalent for full-frame) it's
capable of capturing.

Note: it was hard to capture this without HDR, but I think it's all
right.
