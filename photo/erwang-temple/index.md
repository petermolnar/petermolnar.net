Most of the places which are easy or relatively easy to reach are packed
with tourists on many days. It's really hard to make a picture where the
people don't disturb the scene too much.

As for the angles: I decided not to cut the image, because it's then
visible - check the ceiling - that there are barely any straight lines
in this temple :)
