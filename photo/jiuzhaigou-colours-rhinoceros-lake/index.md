Rhinoceros Lake is just one of the lakes in Jiuzhaigou Valley (九寨沟),
in Sichuan, China. It has a deep, fascinating green-blue colour which
reflects the autumn painted trees miraculously. The footpath on the
opposite side of the road is nearly empty; if you want to escape the
crowd and have a little time with nature there, explore this area.
