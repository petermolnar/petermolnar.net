Misty Albion gets misty a lot, but it rarely gets properly foggy. Fog
transforms the world into another dimention: one where sounds are soft,
views are mysterious, and where mood swings from one end of the spectrum
to the other.

I tip my hat to anyone who had the resiliency to keep exercising
outdoors during this winter.
