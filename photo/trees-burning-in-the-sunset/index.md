We passed this tiny island on our way to Kilchurn Castle and back. Going
there, they were simple, grey trees, but when the sun was setting, it
was lighting up the branches just like it was the colour of the leaves
or the trees themselves. You need to look closely to realise, it's only
a trick of the light.
