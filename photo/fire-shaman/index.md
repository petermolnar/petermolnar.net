Fire Shaman - green fire -, performed by fire juggler István Kertész.
Our friends from Mare Temporis asked my wife, Nora Hamucska, to take a
few promotional pictures for them for their pretty awesome show, "The
Prince and the Dragon" (A herceg és a sárkány).

I could not resist not to take a few photos myself.

Thank you very much everyone :)
