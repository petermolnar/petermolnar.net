The Witch - green fire - performed by fire juggler Szabina Fogarasi.

Our friends from Mare Temporis asked my wife, Nora Hamucska, to take a
few promotional pictures for them for their pretty awesome show, "The
Prince and the Dragon" (A herceg és a sárkány).

I could not resist not to take a few photos myself.

Thank you very much everyone :)
