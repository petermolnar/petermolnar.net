Fire Cavalier by Kornél József.

Our friends from Mare Temporis asked my wife, Nora Hamucska, to take a
few promotional pictures for them for their pretty awesome show, "The
Prince and the Dragon" (A herceg és a sárkány).

I could not resist not to take a few photos myself.

Kornél was mad enough to climb on the top of a \~7m meters high ruin of
a wall - mad, because it was near pitch black -, so his backgrounds are
actual top of trees.
