title: Frozen moment of the 70s

![](frozen-moment-from-the-70s.jpg)

Brustalism, as in architectural style was still present in England in
the early 70s - and Barbican is probably the largest piece of it.

It's like a frozen moment of the 70s - and not so surprisingly pretty
familiar for those who come from Hungary or any post-socialist European
country.
