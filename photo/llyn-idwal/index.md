One can always wish for the perfect weather, yet most of the times, it
remains a wish. Not this time.

There is a National Trust recommendation to visit Llyn Idwal, which
Nora[^1] spotted, and they were right about the place: it's magnificent.
We really weren't expecting snow on the mountains in May, but that,
combined with the clouds and the late afternoon sunshine was just
perfect.

I cropped the image, but apart from that, it really looked like this. No
edits, no nothing.
