The Panda Waterfalls is the one falling from Panda Lake in Jiuzhaigou
Valley (九寨沟).

We had only one day in the park - where one could easily spend weeks -
and we wanted to visit both valleys accessible. Unfortunately we were in
a bit of a hurry by the we reached the Panda Lake since the last buses
were about to leave and we would have been looking at a \~20km walk back
to the entrance in case we miss them.

If you plan to visit this place, plan at least 2 days for it, but even
that is extremely brief.
