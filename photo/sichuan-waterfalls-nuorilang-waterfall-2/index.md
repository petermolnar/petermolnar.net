Part of the magnificent Nuorilang Waterfall in Jiuzhaigou Valley
(九寨沟), Sichuan. The water drops from a lake, half covered with
plants, so it seems like falling out from the field itself. ..It's
nearly impossible to avoid the crowd, but during autumn, at the end of
October it's not entirely hopeless; just be patient.
