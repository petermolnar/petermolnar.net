> About 20 years ago was a marmot couple, probably the
> great-grandparents of today's residents live in the lush green lawn
> more attractive than in the barren sheep pasture of Mandlwand. The two
> dug the first building under the marked on photo stone and wintered
> there. Two years later, young hired. Since this stone was completely
> undermined, and chosen as the "winter construction" of the whole
> family, in the summer it serves as a popular rock climbing and lookout
> for young and old.
