"Szabad ötletek jegyzéke" ( Catalogue of free thoughts ? ) is definitely
the most depressing, most intimate work of the Hungarian poet, Attila
József. A shadow theatre decided to make it a recitation with some
additional tones: projected, live action background imaginary,
disturbing, through the curtain shapes and one single voice, without any
major movements.

I was asked to take some promotional photos for the event. What I was no
aware of is that due to the lack of time at the theatre itself, it will
be filmed while I'm taking pictures, so I ended up working as silently
as possible, without flash, without autofocus ( my tele lenses are
pretty old, therefore not with ultra wave motors ). I was really happy
to have the camera with me; it was probably the most discomforting plays
I've ever seen, which makes me believe they did a good job.
