Scene from the Primeval Forest bus stop in Jiuzhaigou.

We had a very limited time at this point: it was getting late and we
both started to feel dizzy due to the rapid changes in the altitude -
the spot I've been standing at is at approximately 3000m.

It was unfortunate to underestimate the size of Jiuzhaigou; without the
buses, we could not have seem even one part of it, but this was, we were
able to get a glimpse of both paths.
