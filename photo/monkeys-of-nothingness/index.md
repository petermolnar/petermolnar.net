![](monkeys-of-nothingness.jpg)

There are moments in your life which you never expect, never anticipate
to see. Even if you've seen countless brilliant photographs or numerous
magnificent movies of nature, you don't expect to see a Buddhist temple,
with a monkey family, buried in the clouds, where the monkey sit on the
railing so watch the nothingness of the passing fog.
