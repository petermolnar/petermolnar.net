I firmly believe that it is now impossible to take a picture of the
bridge in Hongcun without people already occupying it to take a selfie.
Or a lot of selfie. And one more selfie.

This was taken 07:05 local time, about an hour after sunrise and before
the tourists were allowed in, meaning these people all slept inside
Hongcun as well.
