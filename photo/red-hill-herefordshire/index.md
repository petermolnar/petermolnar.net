While Nora went on a Japanese woodblock printing course in Herefordshire
I had two days to find something interesting around. I ended up pulling
up OsmAnd, looking for waterfalls; one of them was marked close to a
village called Painscastle.

Well, in the end I found the waterfall - a tiny, but very nice stream in
a creek in the middle of nowhere: bog & heather for miles and miles. The
photo above was towards one of the directions, the direction where there
was something.
