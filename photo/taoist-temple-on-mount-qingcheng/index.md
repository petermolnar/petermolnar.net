I think these temples on Mount Qingcheng are always exceptional, but the
mist and the rain adds to the mystery for sure.

It's both a bless and a curse to be in a place like this with bad
weather: minimal amount of tourists, compared to the normal, but you
won't see the top of the buildings yourself either.
