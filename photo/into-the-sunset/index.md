![](into-the-sunset.jpg)

Also a shoot from Beachy Head; when the sunset is upon the shore the
road gets more and more empty. I've spotted the biker going the
direction of the curved road, so I waited till the point I could make
this picture.

The reason for the cut is that I wanted the feeling of some old,
forgotten movie.
