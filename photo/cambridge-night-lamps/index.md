Sometimes, when you live in a beautiful city, you take it for granted,
and overlook all the marvels around you. Unfortunately I barely ever
wonder in the center of Cambridge during night, but at one day it all
felt so perfect, still, quiet, and lightly foggy that despite the
weekday, we took a stroll in the town. It was worth it; we even spotted
an otter in the Cam.
