![](up-in-the-sky-1.jpg)

Taking photos from an commercial airplane is hard, and I barely ever
succeed. This time, probably above the Altai Mountains, I got luck and
was able to take some slightly surreal views.

I modified some colour and contrast here; also cut some from the top,
but the effect is due to the curved glass of the window.
