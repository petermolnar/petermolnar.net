This was taken at an unnamed little forest somewhere around Cambridge,
in a forest where anyone comfortably could shoot a gothic horror movie;
these are branches of a pine.

For years I had trouble cropping my pictures - it felt like cheating.
This is probably due to my exposure to film photography, where you would
not really crop the negative.

Lately I realised there is nothing wrong with cropping to different
aspect ratios. I still don't like 'zooming' with cropping, but aspect
ratios, that's a different situation. If the picture is much stronger in
a different framing, I believe it's ok to make that cut. The original
2:3 landscape framing didn't really fit for it; it's much better the
square way.
