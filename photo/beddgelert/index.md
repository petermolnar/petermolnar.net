Our third visit to Wales was in autumn, and though I've not yet been
there during winter, I can safely state it's always beautiful.
Beddgelert is a small community; the name of the place originates from a
sad story of a heroic dog. It can offer you magnificent views of the
local mountains and hills so don't miss it if you're close.
