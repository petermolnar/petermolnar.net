We visited the very middle of the Peak District in the middle of
November, hoping that there are still a few, bright autumn colour trees
around - we were wrong. By this time of the years the Peak District is
already in the winter state, so instead of photographing autumn trees we
ended up photographing what we could. I was using my Jupiter 9 85mm f/2
old, manual, Russian lens.
