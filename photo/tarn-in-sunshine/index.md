![](tarn-in-sunshine.jpg)

After a long while, when we were returning and passing by the same tarn
as earlier, the sun came out for a little while, lighting up all the
area, including the still present mist on the other side of the lake.

It's a little devastating to realize how easy is to get used to the
accessability of many locations - most of the famous places are now
surprisingly close to a car park, for example. But if you go further, to
locations that are not hyped attractions, you'll see real beauty.

I have the theory that some areas willingly sacrificing a few blocks to
the general public - encouriging every to see those and those only,
while the real gems stay hidden, at the end of path, covered by fern an
pines.
