At a nice, April day we gathered some friends to go and visit a now
disfunctioning aluminium metallurgy, which, as far as we knew, was
turned into something like a museum.

We learned that indeed, it used to be a museum, for about a year, but
was sold ages ago before we tried to get in. So we ended up in a not too
far forest instead, just to make something out of the day. Lessons to
learn: don't trust articles older than a year.
