Nothing special to tell here, except for the story of their leaflets.
When you enter a place they usually ask you what language you'd prefer
and usually I make the joke that of course Hungarian - for my biggest
surprise, they had Hungarian leaflets. Both unexpected and heartwarming
for a British cathedral. Thank you, Exeter!
