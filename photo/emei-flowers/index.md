Arriving at the top of Emei, at 3099m wasn't as elevating as we expected
- mostly due to the thick fog. Given you're sitting inside a cloud, it
is reasonable, but takes away one of the most magnificent scenery you
could experience.

However, it certainly results in a mystical, film-like atmosphere, where
colours are unexpected and surprising.
