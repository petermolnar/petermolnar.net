We were heading back from the magnificient Antrim Coast through the very
distant feeling Glens and stopped for a little rest in Ballypatrick
Forest.

Soon after we started walking, we spotted a stag, right in the last
lights of the sun. It was kind enought to wait till I put on the tele
lens to photograph.
