The surroundings of Betws-y-Coed can offer numerous attractions, from
peaks to abandoned mines, but there is a certain little creek which
looks like a place out of myths and fairytales: the Fairy Glen. The
whole area is a light trip, but it makes a beautiful view. Unfortunately
it looks like the only way to get to the really nice areas are through
the water, which I would love to do once. It will certainly has to be
during summer though, and I'll need proper waterproof casing for my
gear, so it may be challenging.
