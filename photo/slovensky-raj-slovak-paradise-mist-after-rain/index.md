After we've experienced one of the heaviest rains I've ever seen the
firs slowly started to appear from the mist.

I had to ask Nora to hold my rain poncho over the camera and the tripod
while I took the picture, since the rain was still falling and the D80
is, unfortunately, no weather sealed enough for this.
