I barely ever had any GPS reception on La Palma so it's a little hard to
tell where exactly the pictures were taken - pictures indeed, because
this is a panorama stitched together from 3 handheld images from a DSLR
by Hugin[^1]. I'm extremely impressed by that software: the 3 source
photos were with different exposure, even their white balance differed a
little yet Hugin put them together without a glitch.
