Fire Warriors performed by fire jugglers Marcsi Kertész and Kornél
József.

Our friends from Mare Temporis asked my wife, Nora Hamucska, to take a
few promotional pictures for them for their pretty awesome show, "The
Prince and the Dragon" (A herceg és a sárkány).

I could not resist not to take a few photos myself.

The ruins on Margaret Island are a superb location for this scene:
medieval walls, just exactly what is imagined for the play."
