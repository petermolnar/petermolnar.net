This is obviously a crab. What's interesting about it is that it's
sitting in reinforced concrete, that was made to look like wood, and
that it's currently on a mountain, around 2000m.

This was the second little fellow we met - I managed to scare the first
away before Nora managed to get a picture, so I was happy to meet one
more. It's still strange to find crabs on mountains for me though.
