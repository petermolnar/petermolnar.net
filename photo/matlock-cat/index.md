![](matlock-cat.jpg)

A horrible habit of ours with my wife what in case we spot a sympathetic
animal we try to touch it. In this case there was no need for any
tricks, the cat walked right up to us and certainly tried to bewitch us
to take her home.

Being 200 miles from our flat and having a pretty territorial male cat
made us leave her behind unfortunately.
