When I took this image there was a constant, stormy wind and the
seagulls, despite of their efforts, weren't moving at all, just staying
at a single point in space in the air.

I couldn't tell if the guy, holding up the chunk of chips was teasing
them, because the birds never really took their chance; probably because
of the mentioned wind.

The scene itself was still hilarious.
