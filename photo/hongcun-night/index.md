title: Saturday night in Hongcun

---

![](hongcun-night.jpg)

If you go somewhere for a week or a bit more it's inevitable to have a
Saturday night included. Saturday night at any heavily tourist populated
are can be bad, but Hongcun was a lovely suprise: it was lit with
lampions, everything was open till 22:00 at which point everyone went to
sleep.

We've slept in an actual mountain monastery, so we knew it's different
when the place has a history and you're staying at an old place. The
unexpected part was that our accommodation, well within Hongcun, was
immaculate: clean, interesting, with lovely people running it. And for
Saturday, it even included a baby corgie.
