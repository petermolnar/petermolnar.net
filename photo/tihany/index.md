It is always hard to take pictures of places you know well: when you've
seen places countless times none of the scenery look extraordinary
enough to fossilise it for eternity.

Thankfully, there are exceptions. This was taken in Tihany, at a
beautiful, sunny day, when thankfully enough sailing ships were out on
the water. All the colours were in place and I loved the reflections -
you definitely need to wait much, much longer at places you know for a
good moment, but it worth it.
