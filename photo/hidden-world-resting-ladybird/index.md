We arrived in Norra Lunsen, a natural reserve in Sweden - according to
the local tourist information, it's the middle of nowhere yet it's
literally on the edge of the city. After sitting down it only took a few
minutes to notice all the small, living things around; like this little
ladybird resting on a lichen covered branch.
