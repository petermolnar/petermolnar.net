On my attempt to re-create a photo I mistakenly shoot as video - and
therefore only have it in a small resolution[^1] - I got up early on my
second day during our visit to Stara Wieś as well.

No rain, no sleet, lovely sunshine. And cold. And wavy water surfaces.
As a result I wasn't able to re-shot the image, but at least I found
another perspective to show the surroundings of the tea house.
