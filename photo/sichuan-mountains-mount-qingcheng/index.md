Mount Qingcheng (青城山) is a sacred mountain - and so a popular tourist
attraction - close to Chengdu, in China.

Instead of going to the much more crowded front mountain, we decided to
go to the rear, wilder and less touristy back mountain. It was
definitely worth it; this a view from close to the top, with the cable
car pillar showing at the bottom left. ( No, we did not use it. )

It's not an easy climb, but all the Chinese girls were doing it in high
heels - respect ladies.

Be prepared for extreme fatigue in your thighs just before reaching the
top, but it was worth the pain.
