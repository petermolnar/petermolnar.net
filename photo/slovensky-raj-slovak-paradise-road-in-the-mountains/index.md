Still in the Slovak Paradise we decided to have a bit more relaxed day (
most of our clothing needed to dry anyway ) and take a look at a small
town’s architecture. For that, we needed to cross the mountains on a
very, very winding very small road, which turned into one mass of fog
during the night, when we were coming back.
