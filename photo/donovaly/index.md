During my elementary school, our go to ski "resort" was Donovaly. It's
small, it's cheap, but at least we knew it well. One morning, when I
turned around, I saw sea of clouds for hte first time in my life.
Unfortunately the camera with me wasn't half decent; neither was the
film - remember, this is before 2000 (if my memory serves well, 1998, to
be specific), but at least I have a picture of it.
