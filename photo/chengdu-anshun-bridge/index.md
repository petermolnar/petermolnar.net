We saw the beautiful Anshun Bridge (安顺桥) from the distance from the
bus when we got back to Chendgu (成都) late in the night. Next day we
decided to visit it; during the time we were prepairing to take the
pictures a photographer lady told us that it's much nicer from the other
direction. We followed her through the Halloween-themed party places on
the riverside and I have to admit: it is better from the other
direction.
