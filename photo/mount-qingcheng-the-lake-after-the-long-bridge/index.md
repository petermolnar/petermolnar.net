In case you climb the rear peak of Mount Qingcheng (青城山) there is a
small lake in the way. The only option to cross it is to jump on the
ferry which goes from one side to the other. Be careful to reach the
last one: after it gets dark, the ferryman goes home and you have to
sleep at the surprisingly frightening ancient town a few hundred meters
higher.
