On the first day we arrived to La Palma we only started to look around
and arrived into one of the larger towns rather late. This, however, is
never a problem for photographers: we walked down to the part of the
shore where only one people was fishing - after trying to take cheesy
sunset pictures - and started to experiment with long exposure on the
volcanic rocks.
