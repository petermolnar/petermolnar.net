![](penitas-dam.jpg)

During the past centuries there were numerous attempts to make
Fuerteventura greener again - one of them was the Peñitas Dam.
Unfortunately the erosion of the surrounding mountains is too strong,
pushing a lot of soil into the dam, making the water completely
disappear in the mud. It still contains a lot of water though, given how
happy the trees are in the valley - trees, which are already rare at
Fuerteventura.

(Also: a small praise for my Pentax camera, for producing an image like
this, ouf of the machine without post-processing or filters.)
