title: Snowfall in Cambridge

![](snowfall-in-cambrdige.jpg)

This is from last December, and I should have posted it for months now.
In Cambridge, snow, that actually stays visible is rare; rare enough
that with Nora, we usually get up for that one night when this tends to
happen - The Night of The Winter.

Well, this year, it lasted even shorter, but we still got a glimpse of a
morning snowfall. Probably the only good thing of the lockdowns were
that the city never got too busy with traffic, and a short walk in the
morning before work became possible.
