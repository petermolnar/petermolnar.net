During the lockdown I decided to browse through some older folders of
photographs - sometimes there are pictures that you ignore at that point
in time, but on revisit, you see them in a better light.

This was taken in 2016, in Wales; we went there for a long weekend with
another couple. The weather was far from great, though for Wales it was
still decent. Snowdonia is a wonderful place; if you have the chance,
give it a visit.
