We were driving back from a long day in Matlock - apparently we're crazy
enough to do day-trips involving \~6 hours of driving and including a
bit of walk as well - when we spotted a litte road, with two horses,
right in front of a magnificent sunset.

The further horse was incredibly friendly, especially when it got a few
bits from some grapes we couldn't finish.
