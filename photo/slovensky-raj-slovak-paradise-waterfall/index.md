Whenever I have the chance to visit a “proper” pine woodland I try to
find the small streams, hidden in the depth of the forest. It usually
involves getting off the trails ( although finding the trails in the
Slovak Paradise might be a problem in itself ), so take a compass and a
map with you ( preferably an army or a satellite map as well ) if you
plan to go deep.
