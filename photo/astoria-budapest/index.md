I've taken this years ago. There are days when you just take out your
camera, to finally take some pictures and nothing goes as you expect it;
not the lights, not the people, nothing. It was one of those days -
until I finally turned around, towards the sun, not away from it. Also:
use a hood. I didn't. I had my 70-210mm lens on and took this at 70mm;
no time to change, or no other lens with me, I can't recall. The thing
is that on APS-C, it's equivalent to 105mm - a focal length I never use,
because it somewhat feels weird to me. Strangely, Pentax has a
collection of high quality lens, all with "odd" focal length: the
Limited. Currently 15, 21, 40 and 70mm[^1]; used to be 31, 43, 77 in the
film era. I've came across a theory in a forum that these focal lengths
produce a similar feeling to 60, 80 and 150mm on medium format
cameras[^2] - and to be honest, there is truth behind that. So the odd
feeling may just be the result if it comes with 3:2 aspect ration,
instead of 6:7 or 1:1.
