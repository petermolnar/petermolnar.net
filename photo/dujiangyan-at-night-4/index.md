We weren't expecting this many lights in the city of Dujiangyan. It
still stuns me that unlike most cities in Europe, Chinese cities love
extensive night lights and since they are mostly LEDs, it's not even
expensive.

I've never before seen rivers lighted up as well like this, only in
China, but I think it's lovely and results in an entirely different
atmosphere than without it.
