This view was on of the reasons why we ended up going to Sichuan for our
honeymoon: Nuorilang Waterfall, in Jiuzhaigou Valley (九寨沟)...A long
time ago, in one of the Chinese chophouses in Hungary, there was a
calendar with a picture of this view. Unfortunately, I could no recall
the name of the place, so when my wife asked for my interests in Chine,
I could only tell her, that there is a place where a waterfall is formed
from a field. She found it :)
