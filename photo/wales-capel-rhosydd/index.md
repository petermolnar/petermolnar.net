Always talk to the locals; especially when they have a lovely, very
friendly dog, from whom there's no escape. Long story short: we were
recommended that once we're up at the lake, take the bridge and the
trail that goes next to the abandoned building you see on the picture -
it is supposed to lead to a whole abandoned mining town. Given the
weather - misty, with low hanging clouds - it would have been a hell of
an experience.

Unfortunately, we couldn't do this: there was no bridge. So much rain
had fallen there recently, that the bridges were literally washed away,
or sunked into the lake.
