In 2000, we had a family vacation on Corfu. I experienced things never
before: hairdryer-like hot wind in the night, scorging heat from the
pavement in the afternoons, a lot hotter, than the sun itself, gyros as
a starter. It was a good trip, with some spectacular views. Sadly, it
seems like I lost the negative of this picture: I had it in a large
print under a glass on my table for years, and during that process, I
seem to have misplaced the negatives.
