When we'd read about the tulip fields in Norfolk, we immediately wanted
to visit them. Lucky with the time of the year, we managed to get there,
although finding it is a bit tricky: you can spot them from the highway,
but finding the road that actually gets you there is another story.

It definitely worth it though, but prepare for a massive heat on the
field itself.
