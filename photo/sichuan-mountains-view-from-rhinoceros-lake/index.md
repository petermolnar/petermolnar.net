This is real. There is not a single piece faked on this view. A view
from the footpath on the left side of Rhinoceros Lake in Jiuzhaigou
Valley (九寨沟).

Nowadays you have to take the bus in the valley at the front gates. To
find this view jump off at the first possible option and continue the
walk on the opposite side of the lake.

The weather was really nice to us on that day, and with the late October
colours, it is a miraculous sight.
