Mare Temporis[^1] is a historical re-enacting group, focusing on
medieval Europe with some occasional additions. This scene was captured
at an event in February, held at an artificial ice-skating place to
celebrate the 500 year anniversary of crowning the famous Hungarian
king, King Matthias.

Taking pictures for hours in February after you've nearly broken you
wrist with a fall during ice-skating is a bit troublesome and painful, I
would not really recommend it :)
