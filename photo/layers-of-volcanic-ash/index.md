title: Layers of volcanic ash

![](layers-of-volcanic-ash.jpg)

Lanzarote has a unique lake: it's completely green, called El Lago
Verde. The colour is due to the different volcanic ash falling into the
small lake: all these magnificent slopes around it are contributing to
creating that green water.
