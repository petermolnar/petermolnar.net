![](sunrise-hungarian-national-graveyard.jpg)

When the October weather reached it's peak beauty, I decided to get up
early enough to catch the sunrise in the Hungarian National Graveyard.
Though I ended up with miraculous images, it was a bit cold, and I
wished sunrise would last much longer.

This particular photo was taken when I was about to leave and for a
hunch, I've turned back for a moment, to wave goodbye to the place.
Thank you, hunch :)
