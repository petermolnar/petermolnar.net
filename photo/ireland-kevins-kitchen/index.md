Kevin's Kitchen, ruins dating back to the 12th century.

This is not HDR; the lights are actully like this in Ireland most of the
time.

We were just about to leave the magnificent Wicklow Mountains behind;
the bus was about to leave in 10 minutes. I was quite sad that the
lights never showed the image I saw when we arrived - and which I did
not photograph - until the very last moment. I ran back to the little
bridge crossing the river there and took a few pictures without any time
to think about the settings. Luckily it resulted in this photo.
