This is one of the rare images I took with an analogue machine. The
original is colour, but I knew this was going to be a black and white
one in the end. The scan of the negative was done in a common quick lab,
the black & white conversion by Rawtherapee.

It was taken not much later the freshly renovated Erzsébet tér was
opened in Budapest.
