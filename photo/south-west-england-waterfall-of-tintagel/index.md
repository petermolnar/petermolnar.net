Tintagel[^1], the mythical birthplace of King Arthur has everything
you'd ever need to shoot a complete movie: sea, waterfall, ruined
castle, caves, which disappears with the high tide, green land. It's
magical, beautiful and lovely; if you have the chance, visit it after
all the tourists are gone and you're alone at the place.

If you go late in the afternoon there is a low tide and you can enter
the cave below - the cave that, according to the myth, was Merlin's
place.
