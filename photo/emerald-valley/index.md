China has a system to rank scenic areas, which takes capacity, beauty,
historical importance etc. into account. The AAAAA spots, like
Huangshan, are the nicest, largest, most crowded places in China,
because everyone hears about them. Regardless of this they are usually
still worthy of visiting.

The AAAA category, on the other hand, are lesser known, quieter places,
which still have a lot to offer. The Emerald (or Jade) Valley is one of
these. It was delevoped soon after Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,
because it was one of the filming locations, but in the 20 years since
the movie, the area certainly had a drop in the mass of tourists.
Despite all of that, it was still impossible to get pictures without
people in it, so in 2019, in China, I gave up: I started taking my
photos by calculating with the humans in the landscape and tried to make
the best of it.

I took this picture with a fairly hollow depth of field, just to try
something different out in landscapes. I have mixed feelings about the
outcome, but considering I selected and uploaded it, I lean towards the
positive.
