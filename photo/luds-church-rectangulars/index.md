Lud's Church is an astonishingly beautiful chasm in the Peak District.

You have two paths to choose from to visit it and from one of these the
place is literally a hole in the ground. I'm glad we choose the other
path.

The place itself is similar to Puzzlewood, yet smaller in area while
much larger in height.
