We weren't expecting this many lights in the city of Dujiangyan. It
still stuns me that unlike most cities in Europe, Chinese cities love
extensive night lights and since they are mostly LEDs, it's not even
expensive.

This was a covered foot bridge; most parts of it looked really old, so
it might have been one of those things that were restored with modern
base but kept many old parts from the old days.
