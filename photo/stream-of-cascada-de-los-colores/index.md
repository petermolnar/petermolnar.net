On the Canary Island La Palma, unexpectedly, there is a lot of water.
Some of this water ends up in the Cascada de Los Colores, a small
waterfall of red, yellow, and green streams. Soon the stream becomes
mostly red, stays like that for a while, slowly turns into yellow, as
other, clear water connects to it, and in the end, it fades into
ordinary water.
