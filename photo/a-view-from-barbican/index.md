title: A view from Barbican

---

![](a-view-from-barbican.jpg)

This is a view from a less frequented part of the Barbican. This whole
area is like an architecture-history display, but all the modern,
straight lines makes it very hard to properly photograph it, especially
without a tripod.

If you plan to take really high quality pictures of modern buildings,
get a good tripod, a way to level both horizontal and vertical placement
and potentially a lens with perspective correction options.
