summary: Minimalism is not asceticism, it's not about "wordly possessions

title: minimalism is not asceticism

---

Every time I read you should stop loving things[^1] I realize more and
more why things are important to us - to me. Moving from flat to flat
every few years, changing countries and living abroad would easily make
you loose the feeling of home.

Without your things it's really hard to accept places as your home.

"Home is where the heart is", "home is where family is" - true, but not
the only truth. Home is where you can **feel** home, and that, in nearly
all the cases, involves some relics, some "things" that makes you feel
comfortable.

This, in theory, is the exact opposite of minimalism.

When I read those lines I had the following thoughts, approximately in
this order:

-   Wow. Without worldly possessions, easy and lightweight.
-   I own a shitload of things compared to that.
-   Hm. Not a single screwdriver? How does he fix things when they
    break?
-   No outdoor clothes for hiking or excursions?
-   Does he even have a hobby?
-   Yeah, sure.

But this minimalism approach did not let me go, I kept on thinking about
it, and I've reached a conclusion: **that is asceticism.** That is
"leaving wordly possessions behind", one of the few things that many
religion shares.

Minimalism should not be confused with asceticism.

It is true that you should not own too many things and that you should
get rid of all you don't need. If you haven't worn clothes for years,
you most probably don't need it. But as always, there are exceptions,
clothes you will only wear on special occasions. And for environmental
and mental reasons, keep the old, don't buy a new and sell it after the
event. *An unfortunate and sad, but important example could be a black
suit, only worn at funerals.*

If you plan to fix things because you believe in reuse instead of
recycle[^2] you need tools and spare parts. Those are also not the
possessions you need to get rid of, although there are ways to share
them, like signing up for the local hackerspace community[^3].

If you have a hobby, for example, you love painting, have stuff to paint
with. Not too much and make it sure you're actually using them.

All together I reached similar conclusion that the
becomingminimalist[^4] site had: in minimalism you own as much as you
need. Not less, not more.

**It's all about balance.**
