title: I want the blogs back

---

Years ago I followed blogs of friends and subculture "icons" *(they hate
when I refer to them like this, but it was true that time)* and around
2009-2010 most of them went silent. Some even used services that are
dead as doornail[^1] nowadays and disappeared without a trace; others
though still update once in a blue moon.

Until very recently I was not aware that a few restarted blogging on
Tumblr a while ago, so when I found them, I started following them. It
took only a few days for me to feel like this:

![thrash can vs pool
prank](prank-water-thrown-trash-can-on-head-kicked-into-pool-13841055667.gif)

Let me explain.

## You're all individuals! Yes! We're all individuals![^2] {#youre-all-individuals-yes-were-all-individuals2}

There are countless articles on how our attention span is becoming
shorter and shorter, how today's children are suffering from
hyperactivity and that we constantly require new stimulus minute by
minute - but just a fraction of them are trying to figure out why.

One of these reasons could be microblogging and the way microblog is
(not) structured. Content is usually coming from countless followed
people, in your face, in one big mass, within a short time you end up
with monstrous amount of pictures, quotes, reshares, things. If I was
not looking at the URL I would not have been able to guess whose
tumblr/twitter/whatever entry I was looking at - and this is bad.

We're loosing our uniqueness! **It does not matter if you reshare tonnes
of things you're interested in, it's not you, because you're not adding
yourself to it.**

Years ago we sat down and constructed our "blogs". We gave them a part
of ourselves, to make it a reflection of ourselves, in our own style,
our own language. It took time and it took effort.

If I look at my wall, my timeline, or any other stream, it's a mess
which I'm not proud of. It's a never-ending scroll of things, without
structure, without separating the less important from the more
important, without me, without focus. *"regaining focus" is becoming
much of a buzzterm but there is truth behind it.*

A picture can worth a 1000 words, but it does not necessarily replaces
words, especially if the picture was not taken by you. Usually there are
fascinating stories behind good photographs, long anecdotes behind a
piece of art and these all give an additional layer to them.

There is a book, Light on the Earth: Two Decades of Winning Images of
Wildlife Photographer of the Year[^3] where next to every photo there is
a short story how it was made. It gives people and idea how patient ( or
how lucky ) one had to be to see the even happen and take those
pictures. When an biographical work is written on someone their works is
surrounded with narratives, interviews, memoirs and they all add to the
art itself.

There was a talk about and idea, momentum.im, and in that talk there
were serious and important questions asked: are the things you share on
the social networks the moments you want to keep? Are those the memories
you're actually fond of? Do they represent you?

I believe most of us would answer no. I'm not sharing my most important
moments, because those are not for the general public. The things I
share are the ones I would like others to hear about, but they do not
describe me. And therefore: status updates are not really important
things at all.

## Eew, writing? Reading long articles? Ain't nobody got time for that!

> Tweeting time comes out of dead time, usually - time in taxis, or
> waiting in corridors. Blogging time usually comes out of sleeping
> time. - Neil Gaiman[^4]

It's hard to argue with those two sentences, yet Neil Gaiman was about
to abandon social media for half a year[^5].

We have so much dead time, right? Waiting at the take-away/restaurant,
commuting in the morning and the evening, walking on the street and
we're not doing anything, right? Well... How about talking to the
take-away guy? They are usually friendly, they could offer you some
specials, at least a smile. *Or a cup of tea after a while, if they are
Turkish. Turkish tea is good.* Commuting? Read news, read books, read
science - make it worth, make yourself up-to-date and interesting.
Walking on the street? WATCH OUT FOR THE TRUCKS, not for Facebook
updates.

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
> when there is nothing left to take away. - Antoine de

Ever since Apple redefined design *( yes, I do give them credit for this
)* everyone is trying to live up to the idea, leading to things like
Twitter. 140 characters should "embrace" your creativity by limiting
you. Or Instagram: limit you to square, the hardest composition of all.

Sometimes it does help. Sometimes "640kB should be enough". Sometimes
not. Creativity will not become stronger with restrictions and you
should never believe this. Use whatever you want to use, whatever the
way of expressing yourself requires; you don't need restrictions to
create. It could help you train, it could be useful as an excersize and
it will probably help you focus, but it will not bring instant
creativity.

Probably this is another reason why posting short statuses, single
pictures, resharing and reposting became this popular. We're trying to
be minimal, but minimalism is extremely hard, and if not done well, it's
just "meh" - something to forgot in a minute.

## attention ~~whores~~ thirstiness

A long time ago I started cross-posting from my blog to everywhere I
could. I revisited this experiment from time to time, with Facebook,
Twitter, Tumblr, WordPress.com, Flickr, Deviantart, etc., and all for
one goal: fame.

It's hard to admit and hard to make myself admit that yes, in some
cases, I was posting for attention. I wanted my photos to gain success,
to be seen by many, like it happened to others.

Then lately I started asking a question: do I want my post to be seen by
thousands and be forgotten in minutes or seen by a few, but remembered
for a long time?

This is a very important question and it made me think about the old
web, the internet that was homely. I was so happy with less than 10
views per day! I received comments in my guestbook and mails about
banner-exchange.

If I enjoyed those times I value the few, but important visits and views
to the many, faceless, momentary pageloads.

UPDATE Not so surprisingly, even the main(er)stream media[^8] had
started to think about reviving blogs, thanks to their journalists[^9].
