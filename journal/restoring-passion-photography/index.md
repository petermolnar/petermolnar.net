title: Restoring my passion to photography

---

A long time ago, when I was about six years old, I loved taking pictures
of many-many things I've came across with - mostly nature. Of course, I
had a small, film camera, with fixed, 35 mm lens, so the pictures
were... well, they were not really good.

Years later I received a 35-70mm zoom Carena, film of course - it was my
mother's, and I got it after my parents bought themselves a film Nikon
SLR. I used it for a long time, made some good pictures with it, but I
didn't used it consciously. Just in point-and-shoot mode. It was a good
one, until it had a dive in the river RÃ¡ba. After that, photography went
standby in my life, for long time.

A change came in 2004, when I went skiing with my friends. I borrowed a
small, 3MP digital, and I saw one of the most beautiful frozen landscape
ever, and the inner need for taking photos hit me once again. I decided
to take a photography course, to learn the technical details - and I
started learning on a Contax RTS.

In a while I turned my interest towards the digital world, mostly
because the slow feedback. I couldn't afford a DSLR in 2006, so I bought
myself a Fuji S5500. *(I still regret I sold that machine, I probably
made some of my best pictures with it.)* I was still taking photos with
it the same way as to film: meter, calculate, decide what I want on the
picture, and only shoot when everything is in place and when the view
definitely worth it. After a time I started to feel the need for
something faster and to be honest: I never liked the electronic view.

I got my DSLR body as a birthday present from my family - Nikon D80. I
was in love with that machine, and I'm still, but at about a month ago I
realized I nearly put photography to standby once again.

I wanted to evolve, to learn as much as I can, so I went to take photos
on parties, shows, events, and nevertheless 'hunting' the pictures. I
was watching around, to see something marvellous, something exceptional
to capture. As time was passing I felt I'm doing something wrong. That I
don't see things more, nothing interesting comes, and going to event
photography made me feel a bit sick, that it's totally worthless.

Some people dreams pictures, and makes a nearly ordinary shoot, sit down
in front of Photoshop, makes the magic, and create something remarkable.
This is art, but I think is nearly as far from photography as painting.

For a long time I tried to **find** spectacular things and moments.
Lately I realised, that I'll never good enough photos this way only if
I'm at some place exceptional. So I decided to go with a new approach:
**imagine and then find**.

Imagine something, then get your photo bag and go on a trip, search for
your imagination, it will be out there somewhere, just just need to look
deep enough.
