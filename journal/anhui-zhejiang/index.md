summary: Someone asked my wife at her workplace to ok, 3 highlights of your
    trip to China" - I told her I would have responded with the title above,
    just to confuse people. Two minutes later I realised this is also a description
    of Cowboy Bebop.

*I'm long overdue with this entry. In 2019 we moved houses, and had
extensive amount of work to be either done or arranged. Then 2020
happened, and time vanished. At the moment - 244 March, 2002- I'm
finding myself completely motivation, so I'm forcing myself to finish
this: to remember there's a world out there, and that it's wonderful.*

Visiting the Yellow Mountains is a must for anyone practicing Chinese
brush painting - my wife had been learning it for 4 years by 2019, so
our next bi-yearly big trip became Huangshan, and it's surroundings.

## Hangzhou 杭州市

Our flight took us to Hangzhou, via Amsterdam. Flying with KLM paid off
(quite literally, see later), but travelling there as nothing special,
apart from long, long hours. Learning from our previous mistakes, we
skipped sleeping again, so there wouldn't be the problem of not being
able to fall asleep at night for days.

### West Lake 西湖

![Our walks around the West Lake](map-west_lake_1.png)

Finding our accommodation - [Best Wishes
Inn](https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/best-wishes-inn.html) - was not
simple this time either, but eventually a taxi driver was able to locate
the destination. The place itself is lovely, with tea benches, and a
pinch of Japanese tea rooms, though it's a bit more secluded, than we
thought; finding eating out in the viscinity soon turned into a treasure
hunt.

![Our first attempt at nice food took as to a spot which looked like it
was a town center some times ago. For my surprise, the food was not
nearly as decent as we expected.](west-lake-area.jpg)

cheaper eating out spots](alley_in_hangzhou-01.jpg)

![the next street wasn't offering the greatest views
either](alley_in_hangzhou-02.jpg)

![We finally found a tiny place where they served delicious food, but
usual to China, EVERYTHING is shrinkwrapped.](everything-is-wrapped.jpg)

![If you want to enjoy a nice meal, find this place. We went back next
day, only to be greeted loudly, with big
smiles.](west-lake-food-recommendation.jpg)

Eventually we had a nice walked around the West Lake.

![I can't exactly put my finger on the reason, but places like these
reek of socialism. There are so many similar places in Eastern Europe;
the big difference is that they are all decaying and forgotten, unlike
this beautifully maintained park/garden next to the
Lake.](west-lake-park-01.jpg)

Our first roaming on foot made us realize that, like always, places on
the map looks a LOT smaller in Chine, than they are. The trouble was
that we couldn't rent a bike.

It turned out that since our last visit from 2016 basically everything
went Alipay. One can't sign up to Alipay with any European phone number,
and one can't simply get a SIM card in China that could receive SMS.
*(Data card, sure, no problem. Oh, you want to text and make phone calls
with a phone?! No. )* Without internet and without Alipay we couldn't
find any way to get two bloody bicycles.

Unlike in Chengdu, taxis seemed to be more expensive and had way less
availability. It took us unusually long times to get hold of one, so
that's not really an option either.

I heavily recommend planning to hire bicycles, unless of course you
already have Alipay. And data connectivity.

![Both evenings by the time we got to the Lake it got dark. Well, at
least the city-scape was nice.](hangzhou-west-lake-night.jpg)
