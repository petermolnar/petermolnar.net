Yes, you lose a few 'friends' that were not that important in the first place. I notice it too, some people that used to post comments are not coming to my site to do so. I'm fine with that. One can pose the question if those comments mean much. :)

For the communication part I do not have that issue yet. People seem to be able to find me anyway and I'm not that important :P
