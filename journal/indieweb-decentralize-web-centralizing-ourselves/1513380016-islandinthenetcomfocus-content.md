As quite often happens when I discover some new thing or concept that
peaks my interests, I become obsessive, descending into a rabbit hole of
exploration and experimentation and lose myself. Because I want to learn
as much as I can in as short a period as possible. So I’ll spend hours
and days reading and testing and poking the edges of things. I become
laser focused pushing other (sometimes important) things aside.

But as I’ve worked my way through trying various experiments with
various tools in the IndieWeb toolbox I felt my frustration building.
Some things were
beneficial[1](https://islandinthenet.com/focus-content/#fn-34058-3) to
my way of working, some things were more
problem[2](https://islandinthenet.com/focus-content/#fn-34058-4) than a
solution, and some things just didn’t produce the
results[3](https://islandinthenet.com/focus-content/#fn-34058-5) I
wanted.

I stumbled upon a blog post by [Peter
Molnar](https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/) that I think
captures what I was feeling and made me pause to rethink my efforts.

I think Peter and I have different use cases for our sites and I think
we both initially tried to centralize everything on our websites. But, I
think I’ve come to the same place where Peter is now and some
conclusions of my own. If my IndieWeb experiment has become a
distraction then perhaps I need to abandon some part of the experiment
and do only what works well for me.

The IndieWeb plugins — Brid.gy Publish, Webmentions, Semantic Linkbacks,
Syndication Links — have all worked well for me. They all scratched an
itch I’ve had for some time. I no longer worry about speed writing
in-the-moment too short or too long comments on articles I encounter.
With Webmentions and Semantic Linkbacks I can take my time to think
before writing. I no longer worry that the comments to my posts are
stuck on Twitter or Facebook. They make it back to my website.

But some things I just need to do the way I did them before I found
these new tools. I feel like the problem with posting on one’s site is
that one loses some of the social aspect of some silos as well as the
discovery aspect. Especially the discovery aspect. I also lose access to
some of the analytics.

For example, I use Untappd to log and rate the ales I drink. Untappd can
analyze that data and make recommendations for ales that I might like. I
can also see a breakdown of my check-ins and ratings. I like drinking
New England style IPA from home and my top-rated ales are from Troon
Brewing. I also see what other beer geeks in the area are drinking and
discover new locations and ales. I sometimes meet in person some of the
people I’ve connected with on Untappd. And sometimes strangers I meet
in-person becomes Untappd connections.

I think it would be very challenging to duplicate that experience
publishing only on my site. So I used Zapier to
[push](https://islandinthenet.com/manual-until-it-hurts/) Untappd
[checkins](https://islandinthenet.com/tag/untappd/) back to Island in
the Net and I manually link them.

It’s been a struggle to find a solution to integrate information from
the other silos. Until I do, I will return to my former process of
posting first on my website while creating a separate post on the silo.
Before IndieWeb, that’s what I did for Instagram posts. But now I can
link the Instagram post to my originating post via the [Syndication
Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/) plugin.

As Peter said:

I’m going to use what works and is easy but focus on my content. When it
doesn’t work; when it’s not
[easy](http://boffosocko.com/2017/12/11/an-update-to-read-posts-for-physical-books/?replytocom=40026){.u-in-reply-to}.
I’ll move on. Try another time.
