<p>If you look deep enough, beneath mountains of attention hoarding, illusion photography, trending trends, you’ll find the old Internet, the one with content, knowledge, individuality, but you need to look hard. Can it be saved?</p>

I have listed this essay in the <a href="https://indieseek.xyz/links/internet/">Internet</a> category of the directory.

Great essay on what happened to the old Internet, why it was superior to Web 2.0 and some thoughts about rebuilding it.  This is exactly why I established the <a href="https://indieseek.xyz/links/webmasterresources/">Webmaster Resources</a> category here at the directory. It has HTML editors, scripts and generally all the links one needs to build some sort of website.
