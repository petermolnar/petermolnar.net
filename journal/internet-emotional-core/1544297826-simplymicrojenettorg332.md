<p>Thanks @bradenslen for <a title="Indieseek.xyz" href="https://indieseek.xyz/2018/11/16/bookmark-the-internet-that-took-over-the-internet/">linking</a> to <a title="The internet that took over the Internet" href="https://petermolnar.net/internet-emotional-core/">The internet that took over the Internet</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It would be fantastic to return to a world of personal websites, but that needs the love and work that used to be put into them, just like 20 years ago.</p></blockquote><p>I see the (people on the) web slowly returning to that ideal. Slowly, but surely.</p><p><a href="https://simply.micro.jenett.org/332/">https://simply.micro.jenett.org/332/</a></p>
