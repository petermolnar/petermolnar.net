summary: Hi! I'm Peter, and you're on my homepage. It's an old phrase, but
    this place is my home, my own little corner on the vast internet. It's
    been around since 1999, had numerous domains, designs, and iterations.
    I'm trying to encourage people to have their spot on the web as well.

## About this site

### What is on the site

There is a mix of content on this page:

-   tinkerings with linux, embedded, internet things are under the
    [IT](https://petermolnar.net/article/) section
-   travels & longer braindumps are under
    [journal](https://petermolnar.net/journal/)
-   photos in [photo](https://petermolnar.net/photo/)
-   while [notes](https://petermolnar.net/note/) contain replies and
    miscellaneous entries

### The technical parts

At this point in time, it's mainly a static HTML website, generated from
Markdown + YAML frontmatter files with Python, plus a couple of PHP
scripts for search and proper redirecting. This is a result of a long
process, which process is more or less documented under entries in
[IT](https://petermolnar.net/article/). The engine is hidden in
[plane](https://petermolnar.net/build.py)
[sight](https://petermolnar.net/fetch.py).

**Special thanks to:**

-   [webmention.io](https://indieweb.org/webmention.io), so I can
    receive webmentions on a static site
-   [Telegraph](https://indieweb.org/Telegraph), so I can easily send
    webmentions
-   [brid.gy](https://brid.gy), which connects social networks to
    personal websites
-   [fed.brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy), which allows websites to be
    present in the Fediverse on their own
-   [Superfeedr](https://indieweb.org/Superfeedr), for a free Websub
    service
-   [integromat](https://www.integromat.com/), because it's possible to
    build a [syndication
    workflow](https://petermolnar.net/integromat-petermolnar.json) with
    a breeze
-   [indieweb](https://indieweb.org), for existing

### The retro bits

The site has a slight fascination with reminiscence of obsolete
technology; therefore it provides a [gopher](gopher://petermolnar.net)
version of the site.

## About me

### Contact

My main contact point is email, namely <mail@petermolnar.net>, but you
can also reach me on [XMPP/Jabber](xmpp:mail@petermolnar.net), or
[SMS](sms:+447592011721) . I regularly lurk in the [\#indieweb
channels](https://indieweb.org/discuss). This site also accepts
[webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).

I still have a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/petermolnareu/)
account, my photos are cross-posted there. I also have
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/petermolnar/), but that is only for
ephemeral conversations, and all my tweets get deleted after 3 months.

I'm from Hungary, living and working in Cambridge, UK. Linux sysadmin by
day, [east asian martial studies](https://pakuauk.com) practitioner on
some weekday evenings. I'm happily married to
[Nora](https://norahamucska.com) who shares more of my interests I
thought possible, including most of my rather complex [musical
taste](https://www.last.fm/user/cadeirn), and my love for photography.

and if you know what this [is](http://joereiss.net/geek/geek.html),
you've been on the internet for a while or dug too deep into nostalgia.
