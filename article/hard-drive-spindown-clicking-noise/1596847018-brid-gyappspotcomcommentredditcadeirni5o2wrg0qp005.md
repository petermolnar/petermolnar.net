<p>"NAS-optimized" or more business-centric drives don't believe this way.  I have a number of old Hitachi/HGSTb Ultrastar success, as will as 28 Toshiba MG05ACA800E, and none of them behave in this way.  Tosh X300s don't do this either, and neither do the MD family.</p>

<p>As a rule, this is a much bigger issue with laptop drives and those destined to end up in external drives (WDC WD120EMFZ doesn't do this, though) are worse with these behaviors.</p>

<p>I will note that the 1 TB Hitachi Travelstar in this guy's home server is a 5400 RPM laptop drive.  Why is anyone still using a conventional hard drive in a laptop, BTW?</p>
