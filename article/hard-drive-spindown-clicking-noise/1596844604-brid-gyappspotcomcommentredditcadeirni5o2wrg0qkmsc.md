<p>I imagine the best resource for judging hard drive reliability is going to be the people that do recovery on them, hence why you’re here.  Most recovery specialists have an internal log of drives they’ve known to be problematic, and after enough time, get a pretty reliable library of information going on them.  I’ve always secretly wanted the recovery professionals here to organize a HDD recommendation thread over at <a href="https://brid-gy.appspot.com/r/buildapc">/r/buildapc</a> or on here, but I’m sure they’re all terribly busy.</p>

<p>Generally, you’ll see the Toshiba 3.5” drives (X and N series, among others) recommended on here a lot, as they’re descendants old HGST designs that were among the most reliable drives ever made.  When HGST was dissolved, some resources for 3.5” HDD manufacturing went to Toshiba (who embraced them and used it to make better drives) and the rest went to WDC, who doesn’t appear to have done much of anything with their newfound (at the time) resources.  Every manufacturer has their bad product lines, including HGST and a Toshiba, but generally speaking, Toshiba is among the most reliable</p>
