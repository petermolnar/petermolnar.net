title: Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat 2.6.38 kernel vs Broadcom STA linux driver

---

Today, my Ubuntu popped up if I'd like to upgrade to 11.04 Natty
Narwhal, and no, for a bit of time, I'm truly sure, I don't. But what I
do want is the 200 lines magic patched kernel of Natty, so I gave a
shoot.

Download it from Ubuntu Kernel PPA[^1]:

After downloading, install them with `dpkg -i *.deb`.

But, after adding I also wanted to compile Broadcom STA driver, since
the Ubuntu version is only 5.60, and the latest is 5.100, and there's a
really large difference.

During the compilation, a received the following error:

    src/wl/sys/wl_linux.c:485: error: implicit declaration of function â€˜init_MUTEX'

After a bit of searching around, I've found a simple solution on Linux
Mint forums[^2]:

    "I solved the problem by changing line 487 from
    init_MUTEX(&wl->sem);
    into
    sema_init(&wl->sem, 1);"

And hey, it does solve the problem!

I do feel one more step closer to Linux Mint Debian Edition, Unity just
tastes like Windows 7 tasted, and Windows 7 made me change into linux
only machine. Maybe Unity will blow me to a Debian rolling edition.
