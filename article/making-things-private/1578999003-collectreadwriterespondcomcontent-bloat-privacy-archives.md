Thank you <a href="https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/">Peter</a> for the provocation. Definitely something to think about. I have been thinking about the public and private nature of my <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://readwriterespond.com/2017/12/read-write-collect/">commonplace book lately</a>. A part of me wonders about just publishing my <a href="https://readwriterespond.com/newsletter-archive/">monthly newsletter/summary</a> publicly.
