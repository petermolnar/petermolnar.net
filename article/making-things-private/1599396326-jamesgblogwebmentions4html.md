I am feeling this way about my quantified self data. I like to share it on my site but the goal of my site is to share my writing and thoughts with the world. I do love sharing quantified self data but it comes with a lot of overhead. I only show entries from the last few days because my static site setup doesn't work well with a quantified self feed that could have months or years worth of data.

I am trying to get into the habit of asking "does this matter?" before I build something. I have not yet arrived at a conclusion about that with my quantified self data yet :) I liked your analogy for making coffee. That makes this issue so much clearer in my mind.
