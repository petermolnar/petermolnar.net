Within the social media space there’s a huge number of services that
provide a variety of what I would call bookmark-type functionality of
one sort or another. They go under a variety of monikers including
bookmarks, likes, favorites, stars, reads, follows, claps, and surely
many quirky others. Each platform has created its own semantics which
don’t always overlap with the others.

Because I’m attempting to own all of my own data, I’ve roughly mapped
many of these intents into my own website. But because I have the
ultimate control over them, I get to form my own personal definitions. I
also have a lot more control over them in addition to adding other
metadata to each for better after-the-fact search and use within my
personal online commonplace book. As such, I thought it might be useful
to lay out some definitions (both for myself and others) for how I view
these on my website.

At the basest level, I look at most of these interactions simply as URL
permalinks to interesting content and their aggregation as a “linkblog”,
or a feed of interesting links I’ve come across. The specific names
given to them imply a level of specificity about what I think exactly
makes them interesting.

In addition to a [bookmark](http://boffosocko.com/kind/bookmark/)
specific feed, which by itself could be considered a “traditional”
linkblog, my site also has separate aggregated feeds for things
I’ve [liked](http://boffosocko.com/kind/like/),
[read](http://boffosocko.com/kind/read/),
[followed](http://boffosocko.com/kind/follow/), and
[favorited](http://boffosocko.com/kind/favorite/). It’s the semantic
reasons for saving or featuring these pieces of content which ultimately
determine which names they ultimately have. (For those interested in
subscribing to one or or more, or [all of
these](http://boffosocko.com/type/link/), one can add `/feed/` to the
ends of the specific types’ URLs, which I’ve linked,  for an RSS feed.
Thus, for example, <http://boffosocko.com/type/link/feed/> will give you
the RSS feed for the “Master” linkblog that includes all the bookmarks,
likes, reads, follows, and favorites.)

On my site, I try to provide a title for the content and some type of
synopsis of what the content is about. These help to provide some
context to others seeing them as well as a small reminder to me of what
they were about. When appropriate/feasible, I’ll try to include an image
for similar reasons. I’ll also often add a line of text or two as a
commentary or supplement to my thoughts on the piece. Finally, I add an
icon to help to quickly visually indicate which of the types of posts
each is, so they can be more readily distinguished when seen in
aggregate.

In relative order of decreasing importance or value to me I would put
them in roughly the following order of importance (with their attached
meanings as I view them on my site):

1.  **Favorite** – This is often something which might easily have had
    designations of bookmark, like, and/or read, or even multiple of
    them at the same time. In any case they’re often things which I
    personally find important or valuable in the long term. There are
    far less of these than any of the other types of linkblog-like
    posts.
2.  **Follow** – Indicating that I’m now following a person,
    organization, or source of future content which I deem to have
    enough regular constant value to my life that I want to be able to
    see what that source is putting out on a regular basis. Most often
    these sources have RSS feeds which I consume in a feed reader, but
    frequently they’ll appear on other social silos which I will have
    ported into a feed reader as well. Of late I try to be much more
    selective in what I’m following and why. I also categorize sources
    based on topics of value to me. Follows often include sources which
    I have either previously often liked or bookmarked or suspect I
    would like or bookmark frequently in the future. For more details
    see: [A Following Page (aka some significant updates to my
    Blogroll)](http://boffosocko.com/2017/11/10/a-following-page/) and
    the actual [Following page](http://boffosocko.com/about/following/).
3.  **Read** – These are linkblog-like posts which I found interesting
    enough for one reason or another to have actually spent the time to
    read in their entirety. For things I wish to highlight or found most
    interesting, I’ll often add additional thought or commentary in
    conjunction with the post.
4.  **Like** – Depending on the content, these posts may not always have
    been read in their entirety, but I found them more interesting than
    the majority of content which I’ve come across. Most often these
    posts serve to show my appreciation for the original source of the
    related post as a means of saying “congratulations”, “kudos”, “good
    job”, or in cases of more personal level content “I appreciate
    this”, “you’re awesome”, or simply as the tag says “I liked this.”
5.  **Bookmark** – Content which I find interesting, but might not
    necessarily have the time to deal with at present. Often I’ll wish
    to circle back to the content at some future point and engage with
    at a deeper level. Bookmarking it prevents me from losing track of
    it altogether. I may optionally add a note about how the content
    came to my attention to be able to better remember it at a future
    time. While there are often things here which others might have
    “liked” or “favorited” on other social silos, on my site these
    things have been found interesting enough to have been bookmarked,
    but I haven’t personally read into them enough yet to form any
    specific opinion about them beyond their general interest to me or
    potentially followers interested in various category tags I use. I
    feel like this is the lowest level of interaction, and one in which
    I see others often like, favorite, or even repost on other social
    networks without having actually read anything other than the
    headline, if they’ve even bothered to do that. In my case, however,
    I more often than not actually come back to the content while others
    on social media rarely, if ever, do.

While occasionally some individual specimens of each might “outrank”
others in the category above this is roughly the order of how I perceive
them. Within this hierarchy, I do have some reservations about including
the “follow” category, which in some sense I feel stands apart from the
continuum represented by the others. Still it fits into the broader
category of a thing with a URL, title, and high interest to me. Perhaps
the difference is that it represents a store of future potentially
useful information that hasn’t been created or consumed yet? An unseen
anti-library of people instead of books in some sense of the word.

I might also include the [Reply](http://boffosocko.com/kind/reply/) post
type toward the top of the list, but for some time I’ve been
categorizing these as “statuses” or “note-like” content rather than as
“links”. These obviously have a high priority if lumped in as I’ve not
only read and appreciated the underlying content, but I’ve spent the
time and thought to provide a reasoned reply, particularly in cases
where the reply has taken some time to compose. I suppose I might more
likely include these as linkblog content if I didn’t prefer readers to
value them more highly than if they showed up in those feeds. In some
sense, I value the replies closer on par to my longer articles for the
value of not only my response, but for that of the original posts
themselves.

In general, if I take the time to add additional commentary, notes,
highlights, or other marginalia, then the content obviously resonated
with me much more than those which stand as simple links with titles and
descriptions.

Perhaps in the near future, I’ll write about how I view these types on
individual social media platforms. Often I don’t post likes/favorites
from social platforms to my site as they often have less meaning to me
directly and likely even less meaning to my audiences here. I suppose I
could aggregate them here on my site privately, but I have many similar
questions and issues that Peter Molnar brings up in his article
*[Content, Bloat, privacy,
arichives](https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/)*.

I’m curious to hear how others apply meaning to their linkblog type
content especially since there’s such a broad range of meaning from so
many social sites. Is there a better way to do it all? Is it subtly
different on sites which don’t consider themselves (or act as)
commonplace books?
