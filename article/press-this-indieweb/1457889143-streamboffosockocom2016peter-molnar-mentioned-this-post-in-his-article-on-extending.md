Peter Molnar mentioned this post
\[<http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/sharing-from-the-indieweb-on-mobile-android-with-apps-and/>
\] in his article on Extending Press This in WordPress to support
indieweb reply, like and repost
\[<https://petermolnar.eu/press-this-indieweb/%5D>, but suspiciously
without adding a direct mention of it, so I missed the ping which
WordPress would have picked up as a pingback. (Known and WordPress
aren't speaking to each other as well as one might like apparently.)\
\
I'll have to come back to the code and thoughts in his post as some of
the functionality would be nice to have in my WordPress install as
well.\
