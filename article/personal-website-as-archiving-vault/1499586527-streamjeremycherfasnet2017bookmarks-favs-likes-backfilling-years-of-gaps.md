Peter Molnar's excellent guide to why you should keep your comments
across the web on your own site and a high-level guide to how to do it.
By high level, I mean that he walks you through the steps, not that he
gives code to do anything automatically.

If nothing else, this should prompt me to devote real time to bringing
all my old, carefully-hoarded entries into my new CMS.
