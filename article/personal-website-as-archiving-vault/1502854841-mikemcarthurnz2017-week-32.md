### Rabbit fight!

Misty (the light grey rabbit in the photo above) and Dusk (the black
bunny) have been fighting a bit lately and on Saturday morning (5th
August) I noticed that Misty had what appeared to be conjunctivitis in
one eye. On closer inspection we realised he had a scratch on his eye
and some fur missing below the eye, so it would appear that his brother
attacked him. We had some chloramphenicol eye drops at home from the vet
so I used these in the injured eye and it has cleared up nicely now.

### Warmer weather

After complaining about the cold last week, this week has been
pleasantly ‘warm’ and dry in comparison:

Mon 7 August High 20°C, Low 4°C\
Tue 8 August High 12°C, Low 4°C\
Wed 9 August High 9°C, Low 7°C\
Thu 10 August High 14°C, Low 4°C\
Fri 11 August High 15°C, Low 0°C\
Sat 12 August High 18°C, Low 4°C\
Sun 13 August High 17°C, Low 5°C

### Water blasting

My wife returned the faulty water blaster to Bunnings and got a new
replacement which is working much better so I spent most of Saturday
afternoon cleaning the concrete driveway area in our back yard.

### Army Cadets camp

Our 15 year-old daughter spent the weekend at a camp for her army cadets
unit learning navigation and how to use the radios. Thankfully she
avoided injuring herself at this camp and had a great time.

### Consuming

#### Reading

-   [A DNA App Store Is Here, but Proceed with
    Caution](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608313/a-dna-app-store-is-here-but-proceed-with-caution/):
    I guess this had to arrive sooner or later – consumer DNA sequencing
    which claims to inform you various genetic traits, ranging in
    usefulness from whether you are a carrier for 67 different genetic
    disorders, through to gimmicks such as a scarf coloured to represent
    the proportion of bases in your DNA. (see [Helix online
    store](https://www.helix.com). You could easily kiss goodbye to
    thousands of dollars on this stuff and learn little that is truly
    useful – just my opinion as a biochemist. See your doctor if
    concerned about genetic disorders).
-   I have been reading a bit lately about social media, smartphones and
    how these are having negative impacts on people, particularly
    teenagers. A couple of representative, good articles are: [Have
    Smartphones Destroyed a
    Generation?](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/)
    (on The Atlantic, note that this site does not like ad blockers)
    and [Understanding our digital
    persona](https://www.dumbofeather.com/articles/understanding-our-digital-persona/).
-   Also on the topic of social media, I’ve been considering how to move
    stuff that I’ve posted on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to
    my own website (this one). This also includes evaluating what is
    even worth moving, there is plenty of junk. I have manually
    transferred a few things but this is going to be a very slow process
    if I was to shift everything. My consideration of this was prompted
    by this article: [Bookmarks, favs, likes – backfilling years of
    gaps](https://petermolnar.net/personal-website-as-archiving-vault/).
-   Another article which has been timely and helpful to me is [Writing
    As An Act Of
    Worship](http://fiveminutefriday.com/2017/07/24/spiritual-journey-self-publishing/).
    I can easily become quite preoccupied with blogging and so have to
    question why I am doing it, is this what God would want me to be
    doing with my time and energy? [Kris Camealy’s
    article](http://kriscamealy.com/writing-as-an-act-of-worship/)
    reminded me of who needs to be in charge of my writing (God) and
    that self-promotion should **not** be my goal.
-   I found another encouraging article the day I Googled ‘why do people
    read blogs’ in a fit of self-doubt over whether there is any point
    in keeping a blog these days. So here is a few [reasons why people
    read
    blogs](http://www.britmums.com/2012/01/why-do-people-read-blogs/).
-   Poetry: I’ve been continuing to read poems by Philip Larkin this
    week and also enjoying
    [Scape](https://www.amazon.com/Scape-Poiema-Poetry-Luci-Shaw/dp/1625641796/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)
    by Luci Shaw, refreshing poetry from a Christian writer.

#### Watching

My media consumption is decidedly not Christian in flavour: Game of
Thrones and Vikings. Both quite violent and containing a lot of sex
scenes. Judge as you will.

### Creating

I’ve not been particularly creative over the last week. My ‘blogging
time’ has largely been spent trying to reduce the cpu load of this blog
and doing some tentative experimenting with static site generators.

What I have been creating at home is a rough version of this:

Mine is only ⅔ constructed, using old broom handles and in good kiwi
tradition \#8 wire . Getting the wire through all those bits of broom
handle is not as easy as I thought it should be!
