<p>“The F key are not F, but multimedia by default” you can change that in firmware settings, or temporarily by using the Fn Lock.</p>
<p>The smaller <code>{[</code> etc. keys — that’s only on the ISO layout! My ANSI X240 has these keys normal sized.</p>
<p>Opening the bottom plastic latches is easy with a plastic card, I’ve opened my X240 several times, never left any opening marks :)</p>
