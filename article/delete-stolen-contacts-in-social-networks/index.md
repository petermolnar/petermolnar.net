title: Delete stolen contacts in social networks

---

I was long aware that all the big social networks had stolen your
contacts when you installed their apps on your phone. What I didn't
know, is how to delete them, but for my surprise, there seem to be easy
ways to do this. *I'm not fooled: they are most probably just archived,
but this is better, than nothing.*

Facebook
:   Manage Invites and Imported Contacts[^1]

LinkedIn
:   Imported contacts[^2]

Twitter
:   Manage your contacts[^3]

This really, really should only be allowed as opt-in, not as default.
