<p>Metadata is a Love Letter to the Future</p>

</blockquote><p>Meta data lets you turn around and do more with the information and there are different approaches to digital bookmarking.</p><p>Archive data for personal use, if it’s published you may run into copyright concerns.  I frequently wonder how Evernote clippings don’t run into this issue.</p><p>As time goes on technology changes and media formats disappear.</p><p>Media preservation should be a goal of web users and developers. Should I save everything as .txt files? Print out every page?</p><p>Notes from listening to a podcast may be more valuable than the podcast itself after it disappears.</p><p><a href="http://petermolnar.net/article/content-archeology/index.html">Peter Molnar</a> mentioned his post about recovering old versions of his website that were lost over time.</p>
