<blockquote>
  <p>My conclusions are simple: your homepage is called that for a reason. It's a poster, a gallery, a window to you, out for anyone to visit, to see. It's not a social media profile. It's not a resume. It's you.</p>
  
  <p>Whether you want it to be a portfolio, a blog, it doesn't matter; just make it sure it represents you, and that you keep liking it, and keep enjoying working on it, extending it.</p>
