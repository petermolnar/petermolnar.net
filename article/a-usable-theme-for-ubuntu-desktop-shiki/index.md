I never liked Ubuntu's Humanity theme, New Wave theme in 9.10 crashes
some applications, like F-Spot, and both are brown. Now Lucid is about
to make purple (sic!) it's default colour, so that's not for me as well.

When I used to work with Windows XP, I used a theme named NeogenX[^1],
from a deviantart publisher, dobee[^2], and I simply loved it. So I
wanted to find something similar to that for Ubuntu.

I've searched through deviantart's customisation part[^3] for this, and
I've found nothing. Fortunately, I came across with Ubuntu Tweak[^4],
some kind of system management software for Ubuntu. It has a third party
repository list from ppa, and there was a theme repository, named
gnome-colors[^5]. Inside of it, there's a pack, shiki-colors[^6].

This is exactly what I was looking for.
