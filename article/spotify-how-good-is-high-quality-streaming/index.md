I've been looking all around to find a decent review that shows me how
good is the quality of Spotify's "High quality" streaming. No luck, so
I'll do one.

## CD RIP (flac)

This is the spectrum and wave of the original, 1996 CD version:

## 320kbps MP3 from CD RIP by ffmpeg

## Spotify high quality (desktop) streaming

( Recorded with audio-recorder\[\^3\] into flac. )

## Spotify normal quality (desktop) streaming

Conclusions: high quality is still not CD, but is far ahead of the 320k
MP3 output of ffmpeg.
