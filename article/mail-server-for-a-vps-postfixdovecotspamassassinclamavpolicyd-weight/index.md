### UPDATE, 2014-12-18

I've recently wrote an updated version of a similar, better setup[^1].

### UPDATE, 2012-02-25

I've updated my system to Dovecot 2, and removed ClamAV from the whole
line. I haven't received any virus mails in the last 4 years, also they
usually end up as spam, and ClamAV was eating up \~300 MB memory total
(50 RAM, 250 swap).

For nearly 5 years, I always used Virtualmin GPL[^2] everywhere I could,
because I did not had to configure many features myself, it came with
pre-configs and really good backend scripts. But as always, it had a
price: memory and CPU usage, what is luxury in the world of VPS[^3]'.

I tried to look for the best solution to handle emails, filtering them
for spam and virus, and the only system I came across with was always
Amavisd[^4]. amavisd is basically a wrapper for spam and virus
filtering: it can simultaneously use more than one for both purpose, and
most people say it's a nice program. Unfortunately, I tried to configure
it, not just use it, and for me it was hell. I've known that Perl is
somewhat evil[^5], but configuring amavisd is a mess at all, so I
searched for a way to bypass it.

~~It wasn't easy, but in the depth of the postfix forums, I've found
out, that postfix is able to pass the mail to a program than catch the
output and pass to another program and so on. The trickiest part was to
include ClamAV filtering in the way, because ClamAV does not passes the
mail back, so the filtering had to be included into Spamassassin.~~

I've also found, that Virtualmin uses it's configured version of
Procmail[^6], which was the most hard to replace. The reason for the
replacement was that I haven't find any plugin for Roundcube to manage
the server-side filtering of procmail. Since Dovecot has already added a
version of Sieve[^7] to it's core combined with Dovecot's Local Delivery
Agent[^8], it could replace, or could even be a better solution than
Procmail. Also Sieve can be accessed from outside, from, for example
from Thunderbird with a plugin.

Probably for the best security Virtualmin used local users for
everything. While this is an easy and truly secure solution, for a bit
more flexibility I used MySQL as source of data. Per user SpamAssassin
could also be stored in MySQL and RoundCube has a plugin for this
purpose too.

## install & configure mysql server

This is not the topic for a mysql server install, there are plenty of
tutorials on this topic.

### SQL scheme for our mail server

```sql

--
-- Table structure for table `domains`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `domains` (
  `domain` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`domain`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

-- --------------------------------------------------------

--
-- Table structure for table `forwardings`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `forwardings` (
  `source` varchar(80) NOT NULL,
  `destination` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`source`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

-- --------------------------------------------------------

--
-- Table structure for table `transport`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `transport` (
  `domain` varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `transport` varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  UNIQUE KEY `domain` (`domain`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

-- --------------------------------------------------------

--
-- Table structure for table `users`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
  `email` varchar(80) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`email`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

## the vmail user

We're about to use a system user, named `vmail` for all our purposes.
All the mails will be stored under the name of this user, with private
rights.

```bash

groupadd --gid 5000 vmail
adduser -uid 5000 -gid 5000 --home /vmail --create-home vmail
```

\<h2dovecot I start with Dovecot, because even Postfix will rely on it
in the authentication process. Also, Dovecot is going to be the local
delivery agent (LDA) in order to use Sieve. POP3 is already out of
sight, don't search for it ;)

### install dovecot

## Spamassassin

SpamAssassin in this case means both SpamAssassin itself and ClamAV as
well, since we're going to use a plugin to get ClamAV to check for
viruses in the spam filtering process as well.

### install SpamAssassin <del datetime="2012-02-25T06:27:20+00:00">and ClamAV</del>

```bash
apt-get install spamassassin spamc
```

~~To fire up the ClamAV plugin, Spamassassin[^10] already have a Wiki
page for.~~

## Afterwords

This is the base of my current mail system, and it's doing it's job
quite well, but I don't this it would stand as a very large traffic
mailserver without some additional tweaks, for example, compiling the
spamassassin rules[^11], and so on. That's for another day.
