An excellent article! This is my first webmention so I hope I get it right. I too suffer from the notion of over-engineering solutions to problems. Sometimes it's nice to just use the service that works and move on. I'm presently working on an "own your QS" solution and part of me thinks that existing services just work fine. I'm running a technically static site but I have a few plugins that collect data from other web services. It's hard to go fully static if you want to do certain things. It's so nice to see that you support webmentions.
