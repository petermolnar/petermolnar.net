There's a little more to that. subtome could include h-feed parsers as
options as well.

Valid reasoning, and I'm not going to deny the truth of it. However, for
me, a reacji is not interaction - which is currently rising on the silos
- so while the option of interaction is important, the content of these
reactions are becoming less and less relevant and significant.

I totally agree that we need a solution for the missing Follow/Subscribe
option. However, I think this is more of a missing
service/infrastructure than an actual missing \#indieweb feature.

Similarly to this, my greatest itch is content discovery[^1] as I'm
dealing with RSS & Mf2 by sending them as mail from a list of URLs as
subscribed for sites. To think of it, it may not be impossible to add a
little glue system that handles reply email for those posts sent as one
and let my site post them as actual replies...

You've just given me an idea, thank you!
