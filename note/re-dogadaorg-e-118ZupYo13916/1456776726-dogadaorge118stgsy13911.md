<p>Didn't know you use email as #IndieWeb reader. Interesting idea! Most email clients have built in threading support that you may reuse for threading conversation.</p>
<p>#Webmention protocol works really great: you wrote me on your  petermolnar.eu, I reply on my dogada.org and we both have copies of whole thread!</p>
<p>It have many in common with email approach when each party have full copy of whole conversation. I really like it.</p>
<p>P.S. I had some issue with author field of last webmention received from you. Looks like you have author microformat2 on your page, but <a href="http://webmention.io" rel="nofollow">webmention.io</a> sent me empty author field. Not sure about root cause of this problem but I filled a ticket with details here  <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/71" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/71</a></p>
