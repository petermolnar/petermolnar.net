I recently batch-geotagged photos of mine for the first time ever; I
ended up using <http://www.carto.net/projects/photoTools/gpsPhoto/>, it
is quite handy.

If you're planning to make an API I suggest you make it gpx compatible;
in case you ever obtain anything that is gpx already, it would save you
a headache.
