Ana, this is a wonderful post. It covers a journey, with invaluable
takeaways; thank you for writing it. This response is just replies to
bits and pieces from it.

I recently went through archived versions of my site. The contents, and
the generic ideas followed the path of:

-   in 2004: stuff I found on the internet, things I'm interested in,
    guestbook, microblog(!), links, etc.
-   in 2007: streamlined content, basic ventures into literature,
    photos; a lot of former random content already gone
-   in 2010: photo- and sysadmin portfolio with curated images and
    tech-only blog entries
-   in 2015: insane amount of content raked together from social media,
    and other silos, like last.fm, along with the anything since the
    2010 version
-   in 2017: the great purge and finally some clarify of what I want to
    be on my site and what to be in private archives
-   in 2020: a sudden urge (due to <https://wiby.me> ) to dig up content
    I potentially "lost" by simly forgetting about them

Therefore I believe the wave you went through is not at all unusual, and
many of us made similar mistakes by trying to take too much away from
our sites.

> You’re more than your job title! You’re a whole person!

Please make this big, bold, and allow it to stand out - that is a very
important sentence :) Especially considering:

Years ago I read an article on how Instagram is reducing us to a single
aspect of ourselves, because an account is only successful if it's
streamlined to a single aesthetics. It's sickening how many people
started living like this, believing sentences like these. We're not
simple creatures, we should never, ever, focus on a single aspect of
possibilities.

This is probably the reason why I never had the issues with my tech
entries: I always thought about them as my personal notes, and how-tos,
so it didn't matter if it was done before or not, or if it was perfect
or not - it's how I did it. Most of them were results of hours, days,
weeks of works, so regardless of the content, it certainly felt mine.

I'd go one step further: treat it like your virtual home. Like a
*homepage*.

Indeed.

If only that was true. I spent countless of hours looking for long lost
websites from the ancient Hungarian internet (read: pre 2002),
disappeared photo albums of summer rock festivals, forsaken blogs. No,
the internet forgets. Everything decays. I lost the first 2 iterations
of my website completely - '99 and 2000 versions -; I can't even find
traces of it. A few paragraphs later you mention:

> There were a few more tweets from other people that were very

So the problem is real.

There was also <https://www.hotscripts.com/>.

I recently discovered <https://wiby.me>. Whoever made it brought the web
1.0 back into my life. Just start pressing "[surprise
me...](https://wiby.me/surprise/)", it'll land you on a forsaken site
left behind by the first settlers of the internet.
