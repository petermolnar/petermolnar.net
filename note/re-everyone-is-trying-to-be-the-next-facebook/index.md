There are a few, but most of them are relying on passively gathered
information and are limited to content within their entity.

For example, Spotify is learning fast, but their folksonomy engine is
still ages behind last.fm. WordPress.com has a tag based recommendation
engine, which excludes gathered information, but is limited to
wordpress.com posts.

What you're mentioning is what superfeedr could be used for; the big
question is: how to you make this user friendly?

The gathered information (based on what was consumed) is easy for the
user, but it's also highly unreliable, constantly restraining the
interest circle of one.

When the user needs to provide the information, most of them will simply
not bother.

Netflix is trying hard to do both: a minimal initial information
provided by the user and gathering based on consumption; I'm not yet
convinced, but this looks like a good alternative.

This is indeed a problem; monetizing this in my opinion is only possible
with subscription to a service.
