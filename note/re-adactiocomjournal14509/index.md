I very much like the idea of a uniform algorithm for this - similarly to
<https://indieweb.org/post-type-discovery>. During that session the list
on <https://spdx.org/licenses/> came up as a source for licence
indication - unfortunately neither rel="licence" nor microformats seem
to be offering a way to indicate a machine readable licence indicator
yet. It might be beneficial to include a proposition for that along with
the algorithm.
