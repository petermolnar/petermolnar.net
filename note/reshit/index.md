Remake, Reboot, reshit... OK, the sci-fi masterpieces cannot be made to
a good movie ( The Foundation for example would take a whole season of
movies at least ). But. No trilogy from the Weaverworld of Clive Barker?
It has horror, urban fantasy, philosophy, what else do you need? There
are so many stories never been made to the screens yet, just stop the
bloody remakes/reboots, please.
