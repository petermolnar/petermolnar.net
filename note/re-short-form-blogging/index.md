I disagree with this just a little: "If it's a paragraph, it can be a
post."

Yep. Totally agree.

Somewhat agreed, somewhat disagreed. No comments, that is ok - but
receiving pingbacks and webmentions[^1] in my opinion are important;
that is how you keep the web alive.

Categories and tags are only useful if you actually use them for
anything, so if you don't, forget about them; that I agree with.

Virtually no plugins: yes. Also, find a lightweight - as in computing
requirements - theme. It'll do miracle to a WordPress site.

For example, a spouse for proofreading is always helpful :)

YES.
