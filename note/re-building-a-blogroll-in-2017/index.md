Richard: Blogroll, as name is mostly dead - nowadays you probably want
to call it `following`. If you think about it, it's the same thing, the
difference is that `following` is more common within silos[^1].

I'm thinking of displaying all my publicly followed entities - let it be
blogs, Flickr accounts, Twitter handles, or indie websites - on a page,
which would resemble an oldschool `blogroll` but would make more sense
in 2017, in my opinion.

Sidenote: Dave is misunderstanding[^2] approaches and philosophy about
IndieWeb[^3] regarding RSS: we encourage to build sites with
microformats[^4], so you don't need to maintain a separate file and
format, but if you want to, sure, go ahead. However, in addition to a
website itself, one would need an RSS, an Atom, and a JSON feed just to
be backwards compatible and forward thinking - whereas just applying a
few CSS classes to the relevant HTML elements could replace all the
hassle. That is the reason why RSS - or anything similar - is not
recommended within the indieweb community, but many of us still using
them.
