Chris, I've disabled Pingbacks on my WordPress due to an extensive and
annoying amount of spam.

However, I did send a webmention at 2016-03-10 16:01:01, which I've
checked now. The response was:

    error: no_link_found
    error_text: The source URI does not contain a link to the target URI.
    code: 400
    message: Bad Request

This is a problem. The source was
`https://petermolnar.net/press-this-indieweb/`, the target was
`http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/sharing-from-the-indieweb-on-mobile-android-with-apps-and`
and that URL on my site does contain an href attribute with this exact
URL to your site.

Any idea what could have gone wrong?
