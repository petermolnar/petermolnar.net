A bit to read: "[We, the Web Kids by Piotr

We, as living beings, are ephemeral. Some of our data might worth to
outlive us, but most of it probably doesn't. It is indeed important to
live and enjoy those moments. *Some would say those are the moments
dreamers refer to as happiness, so the struggle to archive them could
easily invalidate that happiness factor.*

If you manage to archive without effort ( see: The best interface is no
interface by Golden Krishna[^1] ) that is probably best of both worlds,
and might take the burden off. Thought in my belief, it's still futile:
you can't re-live everything you forget, since after a while it'd take
longer to revive the memories than the time you have left in this world.
