For the very first time in my life I think I'm starting to understand
why one just wants a computer which "just works": I'm looking for a car,
which "just works".

I know I'm a strange male, but I don't like cars. There's no particular
type, not even preferred company, but I do want reliability and long
lifetime. Also my only reason for having a car is to be able to visit
places and locations impossible otherwise, and this is where hiring is
failing due to opening times.

Anyway, I think I have bit more tolerance now that I see how frustrating
can it be when something's eating away a significant amount time and you
don't even enjoy it.
