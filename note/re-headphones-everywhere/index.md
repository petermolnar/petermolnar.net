The reason for this trends is significantly easier to answer than you
think, Amanda: noise.

That 35 years from 1981 introduced noise everywhere: the streets are
crowded are noisy; the cubicles are gone, so our open-space trendy
workplaces are noisy; malls and shopping centres play different noise in
each and every shop.

Listening to your choice of noise at least suppressed the crushing
reality of harsh sounds.
