It took me a while to realize what the problem is.

For a long time, we've seen sponsored content as a bad, evil thing, that
is driven by greed and capitalism. ( See corresponding Wayne's World
moment[^1] )

This still stands for many situations but it seems like there are people
out there only accepting and promoting things they: - believe in - have
no issues with ( neither moral, nor technical ) - or even actually use
them.

All these cases are, in my opinion, valid cases for accepting money and
is pretty far from evil.

Image a world where all the commercials are done by people actually
believing in the product - and not the money behind it.
